index.header=Reader's diary
index.header2=Record memories of books you read! Share your thoughts with your friends.
index.p1=Many readers keep a diary: write down when and what books they read, as well as a few words about the plot, the main characters and ideas of the book. Keeping such notes in notebooks is not the most convenient solution. Notebooks take up space; they are easy to lose or damage. It is also difficult to find an old notebook, or discuss your review with friends.
index.p2=This portal will help keep an online diary of readers, exchange opinions about books, authors and discuss them.
index.p3=Here everyone will find something interesting!
